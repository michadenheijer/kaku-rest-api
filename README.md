# KlikAanKlikUit REST-api
A REST-api for KlikAanKlikUit (CoCo) devices using NodeJS.

## Requirements
To use this API, you have to connected a generic 433-mhz transmitter to your Raspberry Pi. The data-port has to be connected to the physical pin 11.

## Installation
I would NOT recommend installing this at the moment, it's very new and much is untested.

## Credits
Using the [kaku-rpi](https://github.com/robertklep/node-kaku-rpi) module from [Robert Klep](https://github.com/robertklep).
